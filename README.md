# Bop HUB intern project

## To run entire project locally
1. cd into back-end
2. type and enter "npm run start"

## Cans kicked down the road...
* can't refresh on login page or google breaks it
* security with backend in general
* store things like db link in ENV file
* restructure the folders for consistency
