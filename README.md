# Bop HUB intern project
Project created by intern team for the BoP Hub website

## To run entire project locally
0. if first time with repo go into front-end and do "npm install", then go into backend and do the same thing
1. cd into back-end
2. type and enter "npm run start"

## Cans kicked down the road...
* can't refresh on login page or google breaks it
* security with backend in general
* organizing backend code into different files (MVC architecture)
* store things like db link in ENV file
* restructure the folders for consistency
* email and text notif checkboxes enter in the database as 'false' even when they're checked off
* password reset email is sent to spam folder in gmail
* phone number validation
* email validation to check for fake emails that have correct email format
* make it so terminal commands can re run in BOPProject folder instead of front or backend
